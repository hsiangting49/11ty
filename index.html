            <h2>Earth</h2>
            <p>Earth, the third planet from the Sun in our solar system, is a unique and vibrant celestial body teeming with life. With a diverse range of ecosystems, from lush rainforests to vast oceans, Earth is the only known planet to support a rich tapestry of flora and fauna. Its atmosphere, primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen, sustains life as we know it. Home to over 7 billion humans, Earth has witnessed the evolution of countless species and civilizations throughout its approximately 4.5 billion years of existence. </p>
